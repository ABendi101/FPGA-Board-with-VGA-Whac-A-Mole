Basic Information:

In simple form this game is designed to be played on a FPGA board where you flip switches to "whac" the so-called "moles" that are displayed through VGA to a monitor as well as lights above each switch for ease. You score will be kept on the seven segment display as well as the difficulty level. You must hold down the Start button(far right) to begin to play as well as to help hinder your ability to use both hands. You then start flipping the switches to gain points and whack the moles. The difficulty of the game will go up on it's own after you reach enough points however, if you want to bump up the difficulty yourself use the second button from the right to go up and second button from the left to go down. If you want to pause the game at any time, the far left button will do this. There you have it, Whac-A-Mole!
